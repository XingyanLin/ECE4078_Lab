# ECE4078 Lab
For lab sessions of unit ECE4078 (Intelligent Robotics)

## Instructions
Please see each folder for every week's detailed instrcutions and getting-started codes

## Format
Due to restricted access to the campus, you will be doing the implementation and testing mainly inside a simulator environment during the early weeks. 

The lab sessions will start from week 2. Every week there are three sessions as listed below. Please check Moodle to see which one you are allocated to.

- Lab 02 is on Mon 2pm-5pm. Your demonstrators are Tina and Kal. Zoom link: https://monash.zoom.us/j/95668997785?pwd=aEdxMGk4WjNudC9nYnNuSTJaWnNuZz09
- Lab 01 is on Wed 3pm-6pm. Your demonstrators are Yanjun and Tin. Zoom link: https://monash.zoom.us/s/95756638199
- Lab 03 is on Wed 6pm-9pm. Your demonstrator is Aaron. Zoom link: https://monash.zoom.us/j/99132502472?pwd=cmFMWkQ1eEE3T1oyeWlKVFJRRVJCdz09 (Password: 336019)

Starting from week 2, before each week's lab sessions, the instructions and getting-started codes will be made available to you in this GitHub repo. During each 3-hour lab session, you will get an overview of each week's objectives at the beginning of the lab session. At least one demonstrator will be reachable through Zoom to support you during the whole session. At the end of the lab session, the demonstrator will either show a sample solution or one of your solutions in the simulator or on the physical robot if possible, and you can view it through the shared screen and the webcam. 

You will work together with two of your classmates as a group of three throughout the semester. Your mark will depend on your contribution to the group. For M1 to M5, each milestone will amount to 4% of your course score. You should submit your codes on Moodle within a week of the milestone. Each group just need to make one submission. If multiple people from the same group have made multiple submissions, the latest submission before the deadline will be graded. The demonstrators will run your codes for evaluation. In the final demonstration / competition, the top 5 teams will be awarded a bonus 1% score.
